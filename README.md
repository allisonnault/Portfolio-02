# Portfolio-02

## Description

This is a portfolio to showcase the skills I have learned while in the bootcamp. I wanted to create a space to highlight my best work thus far, and that I can add to as I continue to learn more. 

I learned how to apply flexible media queries, flexbox, and CSS variables.
